## Description

Privacy is hard to come by these days, especially online. Your data is sold from company to company like a current down the river and we wanted to bring back some anonymity to our daily social life. Our Who’s App is just that: Who is it that you’ll be talking to? You’ll never know with individual chat rooms established to talk to anyone else in the room, and then upon exit the messages are obliterated.

## Motivation

To provide a fun, fast, free, and secure way of chatting with people from around the world

## User Story

As a user <br> 
I want to chat with other people across the world<br> 
So I can have fun conversations


## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a user want to chat with someone else

WHEN I open the webpage,

THEN I am asked to sign up or log in

WHEN I sign up or log in,

THEN my credentials are saved to my device

WHEN I see the main chat page,

THEN I see a list of all of my contacts 

WHEN I open one chat message

THEN I am presented with the ability to chat and can also see the chat history
